    "objectives": "To determine whether long-term supplementation of goldenseal, black cohosh, kava kava, or valerian extracts affected CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4/5 activity.",
    "methods": "Twelve healthy volunteers were assigned to receive goldenseal, black cohosh, kava kava, or valerian for 28 days with a washout period between each phase. Probe drug cocktails were administered to measure CYP activity changes.",
    "conclusions": "Goldenseal strongly inhibited CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 activity, kava inhibited CYP2E1, black cohosh weakly inhibited CYP2D6, and valerian showed no significant changes on drug metabolism enzymes. The clinical relevance of these findings is unclear."
